# Hi  My Name is Kevin Ezeokeke ! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I am a motivated and detail-oriented  Cloud Engineer with hands-on experience in automating the deployment of mission-critical applications across diverse infrastructures. I have practical knowledge in supporting, optimizing, and automating application deployments on AWS using CI/CD pipelines, with a strong focus on maintaining both security and performance.

I am passionate about DevOps solutions that accelerate software delivery. I have experience working with tools and technologies such as AWS CLI, Bash, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Git, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Linux, and Jira. I enjoy learning new technologies and am always open to adopting tools that enhance system reliability and simplify deployment workflows.

I am highly attentive to detail, particularly in identifying anomalies, and possess strong communication, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. I take pride in helping teams deliver projects on time, within scope, and budget. I’ve contributed to creating efficient and transparent software delivery cycles by fostering collaboration between development and operations teams.

I am seeking a growth-oriented environment that supports continuous learning and innovation, where I can further develop my skills while contributing to team success.

## 💻 Projects

Below is a summary of what  each project folder contains: 

 **Terraform Folder:** The Terraform folder in my project contains infrastructure-as-code scripts I developed to automate the provisioning and configuration of AWS resources, including a secure VPC, multiple subnets across availability zones for redundancy, internet gateways and route tables for traffic routing, security groups for access control, and EC2 instances for hosting applications. By leveraging variables (such as region, CIDR blocks, instance types, and resource names) and outputs to expose key information, this project demonstrates my ability to create scalable, consistent, and maintainable cloud environments, reduce manual errors, and accelerate the deployment of production-ready infrastructure.


**Bash Folder:** The Bashscript folder in my project contains automation scripts I developed to streamline tasks like environment setup, application deployment, and system configuration. Using command-line tools and shell commands, these scripts handle repetitive operations efficiently, include error handling and logging, and can be customized through variables or input arguments, showcasing my ability to automate workflows, improve productivity, and maintain consistent, reliable system operations.  


**Ansible Folder:** This project demonstrates a highly automated infrastructure management solution built using Ansible, a powerful configuration management and orchestration tool. It enables DevOps engineers to efficiently manage multiple servers from a single control node using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. The setup includes an inventory file that defines and organizes all managed hosts, allowing the execution of ad-hoc commands or complete playbooks across the entire infrastructure. With a single command, you can update systems, install packages, start or stop services, and deploy configuration changes consistently across environments. This project emphasizes centralized automation, streamlined management, and environment consistency. It simplifies repetitive tasks, enhances operational efficiency, and ensures scalability as infrastructure grows. By using Ansible, the entire system becomes easier to maintain, more reliable, and fully automated for both cloud and on-premises deployments.In essence, this project delivers a production-ready Ansible setup designed to demonstrate practical, real-world infrastructure automation — combining speed, reliability, and scalability through code-driven operations.

**Docker Folder:** This project demonstrates deploying a Jenkins CI/CD server on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance using Docker. It simplifies the traditional Jenkins setup by leveraging containerization for fast, repeatable, and consistent deployments. The project covers EC2 setup, Docker installation, running Jenkins in a container, and managing containers using Docker commands. It highlights the speed, consistency, isolation, and portability benefits of using Docker in modern DevOps workflows.

**GitActions (CI/CD):** This project showcases how I designed and implemented a fully automated cloud deployment pipeline that provisions an Amazon EC2 instance using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD automation. By integrating GitHub Actions and Terraform, I built a streamlined workflow where every push to the main branch triggers a complete Terraform deployment.
The pipeline securely authenticates to AWS using GitHub repository secrets and automatically performs Terraform initialization, formatting, validation, planning, and application—all without manual intervention. This ensures consistent, repeatable, and reliable infrastructure provisioning.
The outcome is a fully automated and cloud-native deployment solution that demonstrates modern DevOps practices including version control, automated pipelines, secure credential management, and Infrastructure as Code.
