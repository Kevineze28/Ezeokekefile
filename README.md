# Hi, Kevin Ezeokeke ! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a motivated and detail-oriented  Cloud Engineer with hands-on experience in automating the deployment of mission-critical applications across diverse infrastructures. I have practical knowledge in supporting, optimizing, and automating application deployments on AWS using CI/CD pipelines, with a strong focus on maintaining both security and performance.

I am passionate about DevOps solutions that accelerate software delivery. I have experience working with tools and technologies such as AWS CLI, Bash, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Git, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Linux, and Jira. I enjoy learning new technologies and am always open to adopting tools that enhance system reliability and simplify deployment workflows.

I am highly attentive to detail, particularly in identifying anomalies, and possess strong communication, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. I take pride in helping teams deliver projects on time, within scope, and budget. Iâ€™ve contributed to creating efficient and transparent software delivery cycles by fostering collaboration between development and operations teams.

I am seeking a growth-oriented environment that supports continuous learning and innovation, where I can further develop my skills while contributing to team success.
