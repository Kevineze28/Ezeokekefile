# Hi, Kevin Ezeokeke ! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
I am a  motivated and detail-oriented  Cloud Engineer with hands-on experience in automating the deployment of mission-critical applications across diverse infrastructures. I have practical knowledge in supporting, optimizing, and automating application deployments on AWS using CI/CD pipelines, with a strong focus on maintaining both security and performance.

I am passionate about DevOps solutions that accelerate software delivery. I have experience working with tools and technologies such as AWS CLI, Bash, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Git, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Linux, and Jira. I enjoy learning new technologies and i am always open to adopting tools that enhance system reliability and simplify deployment workflows.

I am highly attentive to detail, particularly in identifying anomalies, and possess strong communication, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. I take pride in helping teams deliver projects on time, within scope, and budget. I’ve contributed to creating efficient and transparent software delivery cycles by fostering collaboration between development and operations teams.

I am seeking a growth-oriented environment that supports continuous learning and innovation, where I can further develop my skills while contributing to team success.

## 💻 Projects

This repository demonstrates my hands-on practice with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform  and Bash scripting.  
It includes:

 **Terraform Folder:** The Terraform folder in my project contains infrastructure-as-code scripts I developed to automate the provisioning and configuration of AWS resources, including a secure VPC, multiple subnets across availability zones for redundancy, internet gateways and route tables for traffic routing, security groups for access control, and EC2 instances for hosting applications. By leveraging variables (such as region, CIDR blocks, instance types, and resource names) and outputs to expose key information, this project demonstrates my ability to create scalable, consistent, and maintainable cloud environments, reduce manual errors, and accelerate the deployment of production-ready infrastructure.


**Bash Folder:** The Bashscript folder in my project contains automation scripts I developed to streamline tasks like environment setup, application deployment, and system configuration. Using command-line tools and shell commands, these scripts handle repetitive operations efficiently, include error handling and logging, and can be customized through variables or input arguments, showcasing my ability to automate workflows, improve productivity, and maintain consistent, reliable system operations.
